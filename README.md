# Number-Plate-Detector
A number plate detector using python opencv library.
This project recognises number plates in real time using your primary webcam. I have used a haarcascade to recognise the number plates. The xml file for the cascade is provided with the code. A rectangle is draw enclosing detected the number plate. 
I have provided the comments with the code to help understand each step of the process.
